		<meta name="description" content="The Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) represents a global and freely accessible system to monitor the operating pattern of world’s current and planned reservoirs and their impact on water availability. RAT is designed to address limitations faced by downstream stakeholders in developing regions of limited access to measurement data and upstream opaque transboundary reservoir policy. It is based on the core SASWE principle that ‘access to information on water is a fundamental right for all humans and nations.’ The development of RAT is always on-going. The developers do not accept any responsibility for wrongful application or faulty decision making based on RAT outputs. Users should read the key documentation on RAT " />

						<p>The global Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) Graphical User Interface consists of 1598 dams over South America, Africa, and South-East Asia. This tool provides reservoir information based on topography, satellite imagery and hydrological model in near-real-time scale. User needs to click on any reservoir icon in the main window to see the following options for key reservoir parameters: “AEC” for Area-Elevation relationship, “Surface Area” for surface water extent area, “Storage Change” for storage change, “Inflow” for reservoir inflow, and “outflow” for reservoir outflow. The area-elevation relationship was derived from SRTM Dem. The surface water extent area of reservoirs was calculated in Google Earth Engine (GEE) by applying Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method on Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery datasets. Storage change was calculated using surface water extent area and area-elevation relationship. Inflow into reservoirs was simulated using meteorological observations (i.e. precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed) forced into VIC hydrological model. Reservoir outflow calculated using a mass balance approach from inflow and storage change. Typically, every week all the reservoirs are being updated with the latest available hydrological data and satellite imagery.
